## **About**
I'm a software engineer with a focus on Backend and Web development, skilled in Python, Java, Spring Cloud, Kubernetes, and AWS. As an AWS Certified Developer, I create software solutions that optimize processes and enhance user experiences.

In addition to my development work, I am currently actively managing projects, leading a team, and ensuring smooth execution and delivery. My experience spans projects like UC Messenger Backend Services and RFID Reader Applications, where I tackled diverse technologies and resolved complex challenges.

I also hold a Canadian working visa, which enables me to collaborate and contribute globally, especially in Canadaâ€™s dynamic tech landscape.

I'm always eager to learn new skills and take on fresh challenges. My goal is to continuously improve, manage projects effectively, and deliver high-quality results.

Feel free to connect if you'd like to collaborate on innovative software development and cloud-based solutions.
